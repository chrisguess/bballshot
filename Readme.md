# Shot Chart Explorer

The Shot Chart Explorer app takes shot data analysis to the next level by enabling comparison of shot charts, and in-depth looks of the underlying data.

Its various sections help drill down into each teams’ tendencies, strengths and weaknesses as well as to map the league as a whole to provide context for individual teams’ shot data.

The app is powered by Plotly Dash with Dash Enterprise's Snapshot Engine, Design Kit and Job Queue.
